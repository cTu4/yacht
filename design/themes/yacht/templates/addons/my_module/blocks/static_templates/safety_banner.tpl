        <span  class=" t-15px font-weight-400">Our aim is to make sure that your expectations never diverge from reality, at least when it comes to resting on boats. That’s why we consider it important to check the boats exhibited on our service as often as possible. We are very glad that boat owners share our idea and help us to provide actual information and photos. Enjoy your holidays on the checked boats!</span>
